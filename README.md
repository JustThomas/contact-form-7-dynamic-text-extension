Contact Form 7 - Dynamic Text Extension
=======================================

Contact Form 7 - Dynamic Text Extension (CF7 DTX) gives you the ability to pre-populate text input fields from values accessible to the server.

The dynamic content is generated at page load via shortcodes.  CF7 DTX includes several useful shortcodes you can use, but any shortcode can be used in the dynamic fields.

When entering a shortcode in the dynamic field, you leave out the brackets ([]) and use single quotes (' ').  For example, this shortode:

<code>[shortcode attribute="value"]</code>

becomes

<code>shortcode attribute='value'</code>
